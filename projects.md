These are some of the larger and interesting projects that I have worked on. Some of these may have been abandoned but I may work on them again in the future.

## FF Studio - C# - 2012
A fastfile editor for Call of Duty games. The goal was to be able to extract assets and be able to recompile them. It was capable of loading fastfiles for PS3, Xbox 360, and PC. It was abandoned after I had decided it would be best to rewrite it.
